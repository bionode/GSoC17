This is a repository for all kind of code tests, reports and all kind of useful 
documentation that I found useful for my GSoC project 2017.

## Timeline

- [x] Bionode-watermill testing & mozzila sprint ([30 May to 7 June](https://github.com/bionode/GSoC17/blob/master/Journal/Week_1.md))
- [x] Bionode-watermill tutorial ([7 June to 14 June](https://github.com/bionode/GSoC17/blob/master/Journal/Week_2.md))
- [x] Basic Manifest files ([15 June to 22 June](https://github.com/bionode/GSoC17/blob/master/Journal/Week_3.md))
- [x] DAG visualization ([23 June to 28 June](https://github.com/bionode/GSoC17/blob/master/Journal/Week_4.md))
- [ ] Improve DAG visualization as described [here](https://github.com/bionode/GSoC17/blob/master/Journal/Week_5.md#todo).
    - [ ] Real-time graph visualization.
    - [ ] Manifest file improvement (this might be solved with DAG visualization)
- [ ] Folder naming according to the definition of tasks? (needs discussion)
- [ ] Incremental mode (useful for debugging).
- [ ] Implement streams.
- [ ] Benchmark bionode-watermill comparison ([check this issue](https://github.com/bionode/GSoC17/issues/3)).
