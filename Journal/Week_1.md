# Week 1 (30 May to 7 June)

## Summary

During this week I was mainly involved in the [Mozzila Global Sprint](https://github.com/bionode/bionode/issues/44) 
 in which bionode participated. In this mozzila sprint I tried to understand 
 how bionode-watermill tasks and orchestrators (join, junction and fork) work
  and assembled a [new pipeline](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-watermill/blob/master/examples/pipelines/two-mappers/pipeline.js) 
  for the examples of bionode-watermill. Furthermore, I also started to refactor
  [bionode-fastq](https://github.com/bionode/bionode-fastq) to use stream 
  modules (through2, split2 and pumpify).
